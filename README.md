## The problem

You're writing tests and need to come up with the name of your user stub. Why waste
time hard-coding `'John Doe'` again when you could use `'Count Dooku'` or
`'Qui-Gon Jinn'`? Using characters makes your tests much more interesting.

## This solution

This module has ~100 character names and exposes an API for you to get a
random one every time you call it.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and should
be installed as one of your project's dependencies:

```
npm install --save typescript-utility
```

Alternatively you can get the [UMD][umd] build which is also published to the npm
registry and is therefore available via [unpkg.com][unpkg]:

- [https://unpkg.com/typescript-utility@1.0.4/dist/index.umd.js][unpkg-link]
- [https://unpkg.com/typescript-utility@1.0.4/dist/index.umd.min.js][unpkg-min-link]

The UMD build exposes the module as a global called `typescriptUtility` or as an unnamed
module for AMD/CommonJS (require it by its file path)

## Usage

```javascript
const typescriptUtility = require('typescript-utility') // CommonJS
console.log(typescriptUtility.random()) // Han Solo
console.log(typescriptUtility.random()) // Kit Fisto
// you can also get the full array on `typescriptUtility.all`
```
